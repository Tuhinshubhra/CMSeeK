## Requirements and Compatibility:

CMSeeK is built using **python3**, you will need python3 to run this tool and is compitable with **unix based systems** as of now. Windows support will be added later. CMSeeK relies on **git** for auto-update so make sure git is installed.

## Installation and Usage:

It is fairly easy to use CMSeeK, just make sure you have python3 and git (just for cloning the repo) installed and use the following commands:

- git clone `https://github.com/Tuhinshubhra/CMSeeK`
- cd CMSeeK
- pip/pip3 install -r requirements.txt

For guided scanning:

- python3 cmseek.py

Else:

- python3 cmseek.py -u <target_url> [...]

Help menu from the program:

```
USAGE:
       python3 cmseek.py (for guided scanning) OR
       python3 cmseek.py [OPTIONS] <Target Specification>

SPECIFING TARGET:
      -u URL, --url URL            Target Url
      -l LIST, --list LIST         Path of the file containing list of sites
                                   for multi-site scan (comma separated)

MANIPULATING SCAN:
      -i cms, --ignore--cms cms    Specify which CMS IDs to skip in order to
                                   avoid flase positive. separated by comma ","

      --user-agent USER_AGENT      Specify a custom user agent

OUTPUT:
      -v, --verbose                Increase output verbosity

VERSION & UPDATING:
      --update                     Update CMSeeK (Requires git)

      --batch                      Never ask you to press enter after every site in a list is scanned

EXAMPLE USAGE:
      python3 cmseek.py -u example.com                           # Scan example.com
      python3 cmseek.py -l /home/user/target.txt                 # Scan the sites specified in target.txt (comma separated)
      python3 cmseek.py -u example.com --user-agent Mozilla 5.0  # Scan example.com using custom user-Agent Mozilla is 5.0 used here
      python3 cmseek.py -u example.com --random-agent            # Scan example.com using a random user-Agent
      python3 cmseek.py -v -u example.com                        # enabling verbose output while scanning example.com

```

## Checking For Update:

You can check for update either from the main menu or use `python3 cmseek.py --update` to check for update and apply auto update.

P.S: Please make sure you have `git` installed, CMSeeK uses git to apply auto update.

## Detection Methods:

CMSeek detects CMS via the following:
- HTTP Headers
- Generator meta tag
- Page source code
- robots.txt

## Supported CMSs:

CMSeeK currently can detect **170+** CMS. Check the list here: [cmss.py](https://github.com/Tuhinshubhra/CMSeeK/blob/master/cmseekdb/cmss.py) file which is present in the `cmseekdb` directory.
All the cmss are stored in the following way:
```
 cmsID = {
   'name':'Name Of CMS',
   'url':'Official URL of the CMS',
   'vd':'Version Detection (0 for no, 1 for yes)',
   'deeps':'Deep Scan (0 for no 1 for yes)'
 }
```

## Scan Result:

All of your scan results are stored in a json file named `cms.json`, you can find the logs inside the `Result\<Target Site>` directory, and as of the bruteforce results they're stored in a txt file under the site's result directory as well.

Here is an example of the json report log:

## Bruteforce Modules:

CMSeek has a modular bruteforce system meaning you can add your custom made bruteforce modules to work with cmseek. A proper documentation for creating modules will be created shortly but in case you already figured out how to (pretty easy once you analyze the pre-made modules) all you need to do is this:

1. Add a comment exactly like this `# <Name Of The CMS> Bruteforce module`. This will help CMSeeK to know the name of the CMS using regex

2. Add another comment `### cmseekbruteforcemodule`, this will help CMSeeK to know it is a module

3. Copy and paste the module in the `brutecms` directory under CMSeeK's directory

4. Open CMSeeK and Rebuild Cache using `R` as the input in the first menu.

5. If everything is done right you'll see something like this (refer to screenshot below) and your module will be listed in bruteforce menu the next time you open CMSeeK.

## Need More Reasons To Use CMSeeK?

If not anything you can always enjoy exiting CMSeeK *(please don't)*, it will bid you goodbye in a random goodbye message in various languages.

Also you can try reading comments in the code those are pretty random and weird!!!
